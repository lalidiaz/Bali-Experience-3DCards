                    <p>Travellers, surfers and expats see the island as a truly magical place. Most cannot bear to leave
                        and make it their home. As for the unlucky ones forced back to reality, they are drawn back year
                        after year in search of the next surfing odyssey, chasing the swell of their dreams. It really
                        is no wonder that so many people travel to Bali in search of the ultimate surfing adventure,
                        wave perfection and pumping barrels.</p>

                    <p>If you don’t have the cash to splash on luxury accommodation, or simply prefer the energetic
                        hostel vibe, there are some really great affordable hostels in Ubud too.
                        We suggest staying somewhere in town, or at least close to town, as this will allow you to walk
                        home from the restaurants and bars in the evening, and get around easily during the days. It
                        will also reduce the time spent sitting in Ubud traffic. </p>

                    <p>Tirta Empul is dedicated to Vishnu, the Hindu God of water.Tirta Empul is believed as a source of
                        clean water for ritual bathing. However, according to a Coconut Bali report in 2017, authorities
                        were investigating reports of water pollution and health risk at Tirta Empul from Gianyar. </p>

                    <p>Rice is the life-blood of Bali. It permeates every aspect of Balinese culture, and has for at
                        least two thousand years. The current system of Subak Irrigation has been in use for at least
                        1000 years. This system is much more than a simple agriculture tradition, it is a tradition that
                        is simultaneously spiritual and communal; deeply ingrained with Balinese culture. The very
                        social structure within Bali is infused by this ancient tradition. You could even say that rice
                        is Bali.</p>
